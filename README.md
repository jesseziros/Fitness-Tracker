  This app will allow you to create new workouts and track previously completed workouts. It will display the workouts that have been completed in the dashboard section of the app in a very neat and easy to read format. In the fitness tracker portion of the app is where you will find your last workout completed with all information from it, and links to continue the workout or create a new one. When creating a new workout you will be able to input multiple excercises with the option for them to be cardio or resistance. Both excercises have their own options for input and will be saved accordingly.
